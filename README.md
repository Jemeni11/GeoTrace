## Introduction

This is a solution to the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

GeoTrace is a responsive IP address tracker built with React that lets users look up any IP address or domain to view key info and its location on a map, using the IP Geolocation API and LeafletJS
